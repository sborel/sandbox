The second session was as good as the first one. Having reviewed some aspects from the previous week and complete responses to all questions, everything started to make more sense. I have decided: it's worth coming and won't miss any future session.

Being provided with excellent notes, it’s really helpful that I can review everything we’ve done in each session. I also found very useful the diagrams of how Git and GitHub work. What I am trying to say is that it’s easier to understand with pictures/diagrams than words.
