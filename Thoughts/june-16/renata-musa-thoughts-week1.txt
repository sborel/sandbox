The workshop is really great. All the posted notes are extremely helpful and the explanation is very good. Due to lack of time, I was tempted to give up, but I feel the worshop is too good to just give up. Also, I am afraid I won't have another chance to participate at this kind of workshops. I don't see any weakness at this point and, as a participant, I feel that both Luke and Daiva truly want to make it useful.
